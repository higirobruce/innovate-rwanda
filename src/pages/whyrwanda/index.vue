              Rwanda is increasingly open and connected to the world â€“ an
              important element for market access - through a strong and growing
              airline network and its emergence as a preferred destination for
              MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events). Today Rwanda
              ranks 2nd in Africa as a MICE destination. Rwanda also has access
              to global and African markets via strong free trade agreements and
              is ranked highly for visa openness.
